# Airpod Alfred Connector

I wrote this to work in conjunction with [this](https://github.com/sendhil/alfred-airpod-workflow) Alfred Workflow that lets me connect/disconnect from my Airpods quickly. There are a few other ones out there, but I had some difficulty with them and also thought this would be a good excuse to learn Rust and Alfred Workflows.
